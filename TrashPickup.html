Sea turtles are extremely affected by the plastic bags and other pieces of plastic that land up in the ocean.The turtles mistake the plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them. After the turtles eat the plastic bags, their disgestive systems are blocked, which can eventually lead to death. Over 1 million marine animals are killed every year due to pieces of plastic that end up in the ocean.</p>
